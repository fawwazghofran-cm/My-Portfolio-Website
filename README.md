# Portfolio WebsiteBuilt the site using HTML5 and CSS only, with no frameworks.

Used semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, footer) to improve accessibility.

Added a skip link for easier keyboard navigation.

Every image includes meaningful alt text and defined width/height to reduce layout shift.

Created three project cards styled with CSS Grid, which wrap responsively on smaller screens.

The contact form includes all required fields: email, url, tel, datetime-local, file, textarea, select, fieldset+legend, datalist, and range+output.

Implemented built-in HTML5 validation attributes (required, pattern, min, max, step).

Used CSS to clearly style validation states with :valid and :invalid.

Ensured a strong user experience with visible focus states and safe links (rel="noopener").
